# Stage 02 — Generate Detailed Specs + Coherence Review

Runs after stage 1 (`README.md` + `resources.json` approved by user). Produces functional specs that the stage-3 build agent can execute without ambiguity to create the Databricks resources.

## What you're producing

You are producing the specification files for the demo.
Here is a default layout example, but it can vary / be quite different based on the user request:
```
PROJECT/
├── specifications/
│   ├── 01-lakeflow.md          synthetic data + PDFs (optional) + (SDP bronze→silver→gold or just a few SQL queries to load the tables) + validation
│   ├── 02-uc-governance.md     metric views, ABAC, data quality monitors, classification  (optional)
│   ├── 03-ml-*.md              ML model (train + UC register + batch-score to gold table) (optional, only if `ml-training-serving`)
│   ├── 04-ai-bi.md             dashboard (layout/filters/widgets) + Genie space            (optional)
│   ├── 05-agent-bricks.md      Knowledge Assistant + Multi-Agent Supervisor               (optional)
│   └── app/*.md                Databricks App spec — file structure flexible              (only if `databricks-apps`)
```

### Pick the matching reference example

Before you start writing, check `resources.json` capabilities and read the matching example:

- **Simple demo** — capabilities are a subset of:
  `synthetic-data-gen`, `aibi-dashboards`, `genie`, `databricks-apps`, `lakebase`,
  plus the talking-track set (`lakeflow-connect`, `unity-catalog`, `genie-one`, `genie-code`).
  No `sdp`, no `metric-views`, no `ml-training-serving`, no `knowledge-assistant`, no `supervisor-agent`.
  → Reference: **`DEMO_SKILL_DIR/references/example-luxebeauty-simple/specifications/`**
  (synth → gold tables directly, no SDP / KA / MAS / ML; 2 spec files at the top level + the `app/` subset).
  Two canonical artifacts ship alongside the simple spec, ready to lift verbatim into the spec text:
  - **`example-luxebeauty-simple/data_generation/generate_data.py`** — self-contained Python (pandas → Parquet on UC Volume → inline `spark.sql` CTAS for raw + gold + constraints). When writing `01-lakeflow.md`, reference this file so the build agent can use it as the starting skeleton.
  - **`example-luxebeauty-simple/dashboard/dashboard.json`** — the shipped Lakeview JSON with the 5-stop palette, frame descriptions, and category/source color pins already wired. When writing `04-ai-bi.md`, reference this file so the build agent can use it as the layout starting point.

  **These are examples, not templates.** They exist so you (and the build agent) can see the *syntax* and the file *shape* — what a working Parquet-drop synth looks like, what a populated Lakeview JSON looks like with the right encoding fields. **Everything in them must change per demo**: the story (persona, narrative, hero numbers), the schema (entities, columns, IDs), the widgets (which charts, what they show, what they're titled), positions, types, color pins, descriptions, dataset SQL — all of it. Treat the files as "this is the *kind* of thing you produce", not "fill in the blanks".

- **Full demo** — any of `sdp`, `metric-views`, `ml-training-serving`, `knowledge-assistant`, `supervisor-agent` is selected.
  → Reference: **`DEMO_SKILL_DIR/references/example-luxebeauty/specifications/`**
  (full bronze→silver→gold SDP pipeline, metric view, hidden-premium ML classifier, KA over PDFs, MAS routing).

Read the matching example for **format and detail level**, never for narrative — the LuxeBeauty story is not yours.

## Don't think too hard — call the tools

Spec writing is **execution**, not deliberation. README + resources.json are in context. Read the matching luxebeauty file for format → one `Write` per spec → next file. No prose drafts, no "Now I'll draft…" narration.

**If `context/source-brief.md` exists (or there are files under `context/uploads/`), re-read the brief before writing specs and carry its details into them.** The README is a presenter summary and may have compressed specifics the user actually cares about — exact entity names, field lists, thresholds, edge cases, integration requirements. The specs are where that detail belongs, so pull it from the brief, not the README. When the brief and README diverge, the brief wins. A rich brief should yield rich, faithful specs — never quietly drop a requirement because it didn't make the README.

**Stop the moment you catch yourself doing any of these — they generate the bulk of wasted thinking:**

1. **Restating README facts to yourself.** Entity count, IDs, costs, timeline, baselines are in the README. Quote them into the spec once; don't paraphrase them in your reasoning ("I'm settling on N…", "the failure was 3 weeks ago…", "the cost was $X…").
2. **Doing the build agent's job.** Specs = **WHAT**, not **HOW**. Not yours at spec time: SQL bodies, threshold tuning, GBT vs RF, dashboard pixel layouts, React components, ML hyperparameters, class-imbalance strategies. Spec says "anomaly score: 0–1 z-score, 30-day rolling baseline, target ≈ 0.8 for the affected entity" — done.
3. **Re-verifying what the skill already stated.** Directories are pre-seeded, catalog/schema are in `resources.json`. Every "let me check…" instinct is a smell — trust the skill.

In doubt: pick a reasonable value, write it, move on. Build agent fine-tunes.

## The one dependency rule

`01-lakeflow.md` defines the data sources for the story (table/column/ID names). Every other spec consumes those names, so 01 is written first. Your job is to WRITE all the specification files respecting the story and capabilities selected.
Important: 
- if SDP capability is selected, describe the table creation using a SDP typically bronze/silver/glod
- if SDP is NOT selected, then DO NOT run sdp / mention the sdp in the lakeflow skill, instead instruct to run a few simple, interactive SQL queries to quikcly create the tables required for the downstream resources.
- **"Use existing data" demo (if `PROJECT/specifications/source-tables.md` exists):** the user picked real Unity Catalog tables to build on, **READ-ONLY** (see SKILL.md flow A → Build fork **3.1r**). Do **NOT** generate synthetic data. If `specifications/data-discovery.md` exists, the specs must realize the **use case chosen there** (with its data-fit rationale) — don't spec a different story. `01-lakeflow.md` becomes a **"Source tables (read-only)"** spec: list the exact fully-qualified `catalog.schema.table` names from `source-tables.md` as the data foundation (with their real columns/types), and state that they are queried **in place** — no data-gen, no SDP, no copies, never written to. Every downstream spec (04-ai-bi, metric views, etc.) references those exact real FQNs. **Be consistent with the use case's scope — don't silently narrow it:** if the chosen use case (`data-discovery.md`) is built on N tables, the `04-ai-bi.md` spec should actually use them — Genie over the use case's tables, dashboard widgets spanning them (pre-aggregated views like `*_performance` / `revenue_by_quarter` are ready-made KPI/summary sources) — rather than quietly collapsing to the 2 the headline sentence joins. (This is about consistency with the use case, not covering every table for its own sake — a genuinely 2-table use case stays 2 tables.) **Data-write opt-in only:** if the `source-tables.md` header says the user opted in, the spec MAY additionally define **auxiliary** tables the demo synthesizes into its **own** catalog/schema (clearly labeled as demo-created) for write-needing capabilities — the real tables above still stay read-only.

**Pre-seeded by project creation**: these might have been created for you: `PROJECT/specifications/` already exists, and `PROJECT/specifications/app/` exists if `databricks-apps` is in capabilities. Skip those steps; just write the spec files.

Typical order: 

1. Write `01-lakeflow.md`.
2. Write 02 / 03 / 04 / 05 — only the ones this demo uses (check `resources.json` capabilities; skip any whose subject the demo doesn't include). The table above lists what goes in each; deviate / add / merge as the story demands. Note the order: 03 is ML because both AI/BI (dashboard tiles reading prediction tables) and agents (tool calls to Genie over predictions) can consume model output — so ML is specced before either of them. Skip 03 entirely if the demo has no ML.
3. **If `databricks-apps` is in `resources.json` capabilities**, write the app spec into `PROJECT/specifications/app/*.md` — see "App spec" section below for what goes in it.
4. **Coherence review** — see below.
5. Return to SKILL.md for the next stage.

## Spec-writing standards

Functional specs — **what** to build, not **how**. Each file must be unambiguous for another agent to execute.

- **Story alignment (the one rule that overrides all the others).** Every spec serves the demo story end-to-end. Before writing anything in a spec, hold the whole arc in mind: the data the pipeline produces → the gold tables → the dashboard widgets → the Genie questions → the KA docs → the agent's tool chain → the app pages → the closing line in the README walkthrough. Each piece must feed the next. A column you add must show up where it's needed; a Genie question must be answerable by the data; a KA doc must contain the phrase the demo flow asks about; the app's "fix it" button must mutate a table that's actually present. If you can't trace a spec decision back to a moment in the README walkthrough, it doesn't belong. Every spec should be read as *"how does this serve the story?"* — not *"what does this product technically support?"*.
- **Deterministic values**: exact IDs, names, numbers that must be reproduced.
- **Schemas**: column names, types, relationships, counts. Correct but high-level — avoid over-specifying types you'll regret.
- **The event**: distributions and anomalies that make the data interesting. The story's catalyst (`stages/01-design-story.md` → Catalyst) committed to two rules — specs enforce them:
  - **Signal visible to the eye.** When the dashboard renders, anyone in the room should point at the anomaly without squinting. Realistic noise + a subtle event = invisible chart. If signal-to-noise is borderline, dial the event up or the noise down. Make the trade-off explicit (e.g. *"the lot's return spike must dominate baseline daily variance"*).
  - **Temporal realism — peak in the past, avoid at the chart edge.** Build-up → peak → decay back toward baseline. Anchor the peak ~2–4 weeks ago with explicit timestamps (`SPIKE_PEAK = NOW − 3 weeks`, `DECAY_START = NOW − 2 weeks`). A spike at the rightmost edge looks like a cliff, not a story.
- **Coherence contracts**: which columns/tables are consumed downstream (gold-table dimensions must match dashboard filters, KPI definitions must match Genie answers, KA document content must contain what the demo flow asks about, identifiers must match across data and PDFs).
- **Dashboard**: read the capability block `DEMO_SKILL_DIR/references/blocks/capabilities/aibi-dashboards.md` — it covers widget types, encoding rules, theme + color pinning, frame descriptions, sankey top-N bucketing, the symbol-map nested-coordinates pattern, and all the silent-failure pitfalls. Prefer charts that group/color by a key dimension (region, category, segment). Bar charts stacked/grouped by the filter dimension; line charts colored by region or category. **`databricks-aibi-dashboards`** (the Databricks Agent Skill, DAS) handles HOW to emit the JSON during Stage 3; this spec stays WHAT-only.
- **Genie / MAS**: make sure it's all connected to the data, and typically to the KA (pdf docs) if the MAS + KA capabilities are selected
- **Shared values defined once**: affected SKUs, lot, persona, baseline metrics live in `01-lakeflow.md`. Later specs reference "from 01" instead of restating.

## App spec

**Skip this section unless `databricks-apps` is in `resources.json` capabilities.**

The Databricks App for this demo starts from a generic template at `DEMO_SKILL_DIR/app/app_template/`. During Stage 3 (build), the template is copied into `PROJECT/app/` and customized per spec. You are **not writing a spec from scratch** — you are writing a spec that describes how to adapt this template to this demo's story.

**But the template is a starting point, not a cage.** The spec describes the app *this demo* needs — which may have fewer components than the template (e.g. the **Simple demo**: Genie as the data tool instead of MAS, no KA, no ML tiering), more/different ones (a second entity, an extra page, a tool the template lacks), or an **entirely different shape** (different pages, navigation, and primary interaction, no operations-queue at all). If the demo calls for that, **spec a wholesale rewrite of the pages and layout** — the build agent will redraw `HomeView`, the operations page, the routes and sidebar, keeping only the reusable plumbing (chat dock + streaming, MLflow tracing, OBO auth, Delta→Lakebase sync, config substitution). Spec the app the *story* needs; don't shrink the story to fit the template's screens.

You don't need to scan the template's source code. `TEMPLATE_MAP.md` describes what ships (surfaces, agent tools, Lakebase schema, streaming infra) — that's all you need.
You are free to change the app especialy the operational part, and change/add menus so that it's easy to understand, eyes catching (visual components are the best), aligned with the story.

### Read these before writing the app spec

- `DEMO_SKILL_DIR/app/app_template/TEMPLATE_MAP.md` — **most important.** Functional summary of what ships, the canonical demo arc, what to preserve vs. rewrite. Authoritative; do not scan source code.
- `DEMO_SKILL_DIR/app/app.md` — how the template is copied + customized during build.
- Worked-example folder — **pick the matching one** (see "Pick the matching reference example" above):
  - Full-stack demo → `DEMO_SKILL_DIR/references/example-luxebeauty/specifications/app/` (MAS + KA + ML tier-split).
  - Simple demo → `DEMO_SKILL_DIR/references/example-luxebeauty-simple/specifications/app/` (single-agent Genie tool, flat 10% offer, no premium tiering).

  **LuxeBeauty's returns domain is not yours.** Read for format, file count, density. Never copy narrative, persona, tool names, or page content.

### What to write

- **Location:** `PROJECT/specifications/app/*.md`.
- **File structure is flexible.** Luxebeauty has 4 files (overview+home+assistant / operations / analytics+dashboard / data model); adapt as needed.
- **You decide** file count, names, pages, tools, demo flow — derived from this demo's README + 01-lakeflow.

### Scope rules

- Domain/story matches this demo's README; the template is example/inspiration only, from a different use case.
- Aim for **1 operations page** with a precise spec.
- Focus areas: narrative coherence (persona/story/starter questions/scripted demo chain align with README + data specs) · agent behavior (tools, 3-phase action chain adapted to domain) · pages (what each shows, how it maps to Databricks capabilities) · data model (Delta→Lakebase mirror, entity shape, append-only audit).
- Not a full app. Focused subset: something is wrong → user asks the agent why → agent has tools to fix it (tools mock external calls). Keep it simple.
- Adaptability: no MAS → Genie or pure agent; no dashboard → remove page; no KA → MAS routes to Genie only.
- **Design the page from the persona, not from the template.** The template ships a particular page shape that fits its own story; reusing it verbatim with renamed columns produces an app that looks like the template no matter how the data is labeled. Ask: *what does this persona stare at all day?* The answer drives the primary visualization — a map, a grid, a chart, a schematic, a timeline, or a queue depending on the domain. Imagine the screenshot in the demo recording: if it would read as *"a table with rows"*, redesign until it reads as *"this is a {domain} app"* at a glance.

### Data must enable a visual, eye-catching app

The app's primary page needs data shaped for **a strong visual hook**, not just rows in a table. When designing `01-lakeflow.md` and the gold tables this app will sync to Lakebase, make sure the schema supports the visualization the app will use:

- If the page is a map or geospatial grid → entities need stable IDs, positions (or cluster/site labels), and a health/status field.
- If the page is a chart or sparkline → entities need a time series with enough density and a clearly visible anomaly inside the window.
- If the page is a heat map / scorecard → entities need a numeric metric with a wide value spread so colors are differentiated.
- Any page → the affected entity (the one the demo's story spotlights) must be **immediately distinguishable** from the rest of the fleet/cohort by a single column the UI can color/badge/highlight.

Cross-check during coherence review: open the app's data model in your head and ask *"if I render this on screen, does the anomaly the story is about jump out, or does it require squinting?"* If it requires squinting, the data spec needs more contrast — either bigger relative gaps or a derived flag column the UI can color by.

## Coherence review

Before the build gate, verify everything connects. Edit where needed.

- [ ] Data generation math is coherent with story metrics.
- [ ] Data supports every dashboard widget (columns, aggregations, filter dimensions) and every Genie question.
- [ ] Documents (if any) contain what KA queries expect.
- [ ] Identifiers match across data and documents (lot IDs, SKUs, dates).
- [ ] Key numbers are consistent everywhere (same amounts, same rates).
- [ ] Demo flow works end-to-end (each step feeds the next) and highlights Databricks features.
- [ ] Specs are functional (WHAT), not technical (HOW).

**Final review question**: *"Is this a great, coherent story? Is the data there to support every downstream consumer? Did I follow all user instructions?"*

Once coherence is done, return to SKILL.md for the stage-2 build-or-stop gate.
