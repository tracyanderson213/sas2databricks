-- Silver Layer — clean joined fact + ai_classify anger score.
-- Reads the RAW PARQUET FILES straight from the UC Volume landing zone
-- (/Volumes/${catalog}/${schema}/raw_data/<dataset>/) via read_files() — no
-- bronze pass-through. The data-gen script lands one parquet dataset per raw_*
-- table there. Emits the silver tables consumed downstream:
--   - silver_returns: enriched returns fact (used by gold + the app)
--   - silver_order_items: denormalized order lines (used by gold)
--   - silver_orders:  order-level totals (used by the Lakebase sync)
--   - silver_production_lots: lot master exposed for Genie's incident drill-down
-- Plus comment_anger_scores: a small dedup MV so ai_classify runs once per
-- distinct comment instead of once per row.

-- ai_classify dedup: the synth uses a canned pool of ~20 distinct
-- `customer_comment` strings, but raw_returns has ~13K rows. Score each
-- DISTINCT comment once and join the result back into silver_returns.
-- Drops the LLM call count from O(rows) to O(distinct).
