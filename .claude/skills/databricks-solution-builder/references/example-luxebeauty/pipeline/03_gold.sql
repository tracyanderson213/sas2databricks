-- Gold Layer — analytics + ML feeds. Each MV is consumed by the dashboard,
-- Genie, or the ML script — nothing here is intermediate.

-- gold_daily_summary: (date, region, category) — powers `mv_returns`
-- metric view per spec 02-uc-governance.md and the dashboard KPI/trend.
-- raw_orders is order-level (order_id, customer_id, order_date, region,
-- total_usd, n_items) and raw_order_items carries the per-line
-- (product_id, quantity, unit_price_usd, line_total_usd) — so we join the
-- two to roll up by (date, region, category).
