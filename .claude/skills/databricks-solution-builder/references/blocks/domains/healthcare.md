## Terminology

- **EHR / EMR** — Electronic Health Record / Electronic Medical Record; primary clinical data system (Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH)
- **ICD-10** — International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision; standardized diagnosis codes (e.g., I50.9 = heart failure, unspecified)
- **CPT** — Current Procedural Terminology; codes for medical procedures and services billed to payers
- **DRG** — Diagnosis Related Group; classification system grouping hospital cases for fixed reimbursement
- **TAVR** — Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement; minimally invasive cardiac procedure
- **ADT** — Admit, Discharge, Transfer; core hospital event feed tracking patient movement
- **SDOH** — Social Determinants of Health; non-clinical factors (housing, food access, transportation) affecting outcomes
- **Prior authorization** — Payer requirement for pre-approval before covering a procedure or medication
- **Formulary** — List of medications covered by an insurance plan, organized by tier and co-pay level
- **NNT** — Number Needed to Treat; how many patients must receive a treatment for one to benefit
- **CRO** — Contract Research Organization; third party conducting clinical trial operations
- **Phase I/II/III/IV** — Clinical trial phases from safety (I) through post-market surveillance (IV)

## KPIs and Baseline Metrics

| KPI | Healthy Baseline | Red Flag |
|-----|-----------------|----------|
| 30-day readmission rate (all-cause) | 10-13% | >15% (CMS penalty threshold) |
| Average length of stay (ALOS) | 4.5-5.5 days (medical) | >7 days |
| Hospital-acquired infection rate | 0.5-1.0 per 1,000 patient-days | >2.0 |
| ED boarding time | <4 hours | >8 hours |
| Claims denial rate | 5-10% | >15% |
| Clinical trial enrollment rate | 70-85% of target | <50% of target |
| Drug adverse event reporting (ICSR) | Processed within 15 days | Backlog >30 days |
| Patient satisfaction (HCAHPS top-box) | 70-75% | <65% |
| Bed occupancy rate | 75-85% | >92% (strain) or <60% (underutilized) |
| Time to first dose (ED) | <60 minutes | >90 minutes |

## Personas

- **Dr. Sarah Patel, Chief Medical Officer** — Accountable for clinical quality metrics, readmission penalties, and physician practice variation. Reports to the board on patient safety and outcomes.
- **Karen Whitfield, VP of Revenue Cycle** — Owns claims submissions, denial management, and payer contract negotiations. Focused on reducing days in A/R and clean claim rates.
- **Michael Torres, Director of Clinical Informatics** — Bridges IT and clinical operations. Manages EHR data extraction, clinical decision support rules, and interoperability initiatives (HL7 FHIR).
- **Dr. Anika Rao, VP of Clinical Development (Pharma)** — Leads clinical trial design, site selection, and regulatory submissions. Cares about enrollment velocity, protocol deviations, and time-to-market.

## Data Entities and Relationships

- **Patients** (patient_id, mrn, dob, gender, zip_code, insurance_id, pcp_id, risk_score)
- **Encounters** (encounter_id, patient_id, facility_id, admit_date, discharge_date, encounter_type, drg_code, attending_provider_id)
- **Diagnoses** (encounter_id, icd10_code, diagnosis_rank, present_on_admission_flag)
- **Procedures** (encounter_id, cpt_code, procedure_date, performing_provider_id)
- **Medications** (order_id, patient_id, ndc_code, drug_name, dose, route, start_date, end_date)
- **Lab Results** (result_id, patient_id, loinc_code, test_name, value, unit, reference_range, result_date)
- **Claims** (claim_id, encounter_id, payer_id, billed_amount, allowed_amount, paid_amount, denial_code, status)
- **Clinical Trials** (trial_id, nct_number, phase, therapeutic_area, enrollment_target, site_ids)
- **Trial Subjects** (subject_id, trial_id, site_id, consent_date, randomization_arm, status, adverse_events)

Key relationships: Patients -> Encounters -> (Diagnoses, Procedures, Medications, Lab Results); Encounters -> Claims; Trial Subjects reference Patients at participating sites.

## Regulatory and Compliance

- **HIPAA** — Protected Health Information (PHI) requires encryption at rest and in transit, minimum necessary access, and Business Associate Agreements for all data processors
- **CMS Quality Programs** — Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program penalizes up to 3% of Medicare reimbursement; Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program penalizes bottom quartile
- **21st Century Cures Act** — Mandates patient data access via standardized APIs (FHIR); prohibits information blocking
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** — Electronic records in clinical trials must have audit trails, electronic signatures, and validated systems
- **GDPR (EU clinical trials)** — Cross-border trial data requires Data Protection Impact Assessments and lawful basis for processing
- **GxP (GLP, GCP, GMP)** — Good Practice regulations governing lab work, clinical trials, and drug manufacturing; require validated data pipelines and change control

## Common Pain Points and Use Cases

1. **Readmission risk prediction** — CMS penalties cost hospitals $500M+ annually. Models need to incorporate SDOH data, medication adherence, and post-discharge follow-up gaps to identify patients needing proactive outreach within the 30-day window.
2. **Claims denial prevention** — 10-15% of claims are denied on first submission; rework costs $25-30 per claim. NLP on clinical notes can identify missing documentation before submission.
3. **Clinical trial site selection** — Finding sites with sufficient eligible patient populations, experienced PIs, and low screen-failure rates. EHR-based feasibility queries can accelerate enrollment by 30-40%.
4. **Drug interaction and adverse event detection** — Real-world evidence from EHR data can surface safety signals faster than traditional pharmacovigilance. NLP on clinical notes captures events missed by structured data.
5. **Patient flow optimization** — ED boarding, OR scheduling, and bed management require real-time predictive models. A 1-hour reduction in average boarding time can save a 400-bed hospital $2-4M annually.
6. **Social determinants integration** — Linking census, housing, and food-access data to patient records improves risk stratification accuracy by 15-20% but requires careful de-identification and consent management.
