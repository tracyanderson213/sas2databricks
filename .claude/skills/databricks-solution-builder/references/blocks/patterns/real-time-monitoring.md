## Narrative Arc

1. **Steady state** -- The monitoring surface shows all systems nominal; live data streams update continuously.
2. **Emerging signal** -- A metric begins trending toward a threshold; the system highlights it before it becomes critical.
3. **Threshold breach** -- The metric crosses the alert boundary; automated alerts fire and initial response workflows trigger.
4. **Situational awareness** -- The operator uses conversational queries and document retrieval to understand context and assess severity.
5. **Response and stabilization** -- Automated and human actions bring the situation under control; the system logs the incident for post-event analysis.

## Data Shape

| Layer | Abstract Entity | Role |
|-------|----------------|------|
| Streaming fact | Live event stream | High-velocity data arriving continuously (telemetry, ticks, vitals, log events) |
| Fact table | Historical events | Persisted event history for trend analysis and pattern matching |
| Fact table | Alerts / Incidents | System-generated alerts with severity, timestamp, and disposition |
| Dimension | Monitored entities | The assets, systems, or subjects being watched (servers, patients, routes, instruments) |
| Dimension | Thresholds / Rules | Configurable alert boundaries and escalation policies |
| Aggregate | Real-time rollups | Windowed aggregations (last 5 min, last hour) for dashboard responsiveness |
| Unstructured | Runbooks / Procedures | Standard operating procedures, escalation playbooks, incident response guides |

The data must demonstrate both streaming velocity and historical depth. Live streams should update at sub-minute intervals. The demo should show at least one metric transitioning from normal to warning to critical in real time. Historical data provides the backdrop for trend comparison.

## Wow Moment Pattern

The demo peaks with a live threshold breach -- the audience watches a metric cross its boundary in real time, sees the dashboard flash an alert, and watches the automated response initiate within seconds. The immediacy is the hook: the system detected, alerted, and began responding before the audience fully processed what happened. A second wow moment comes when the operator asks a natural-language question about the incident and gets an instant, context-rich answer combining live data with historical patterns and runbook guidance.

## Investigation / Discovery Flow

1. **Operations overview** -- Live dashboard shows all monitored entities with current status; green/yellow/red indicators.
2. **Trend detection** -- A metric begins trending upward; the dashboard highlights the trajectory before it reaches the threshold.
3. **Alert response** -- Threshold breach triggers an alert; the operator clicks through to the alert detail view.
4. **Contextual query** -- Genie answers real-time questions ("Is this pattern similar to last month's incident?" "Which other entities are showing correlated behavior?").
5. **Runbook retrieval** -- Knowledge Assistant surfaces the relevant standard operating procedure for this alert type.
6. **Resolution tracking** -- The operator follows the runbook, takes corrective action, and the dashboard reflects stabilization in real time.

## Example Walkthrough Beats (5-Act Structure)

| Act | Beat | What Happens |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 - Setup | Calm operations | Live dashboard shows all systems green; streaming data updates visibly in real time to establish the live feed |
| 2 - Inciting Incident | Trend emerges | One metric begins creeping upward; the dashboard shifts it to amber and projects time-to-threshold |
| 3 - Escalation | Alert fires | The metric breaches its threshold; alert banner appears, automated notification triggers, initial response workflow begins |
| 4 - Investigation | Rapid context | Operator asks Genie for correlated signals and historical comparison; Knowledge Assistant provides the incident response runbook |
| 5 - Resolution | Stabilization | Corrective action is taken (automated or manual); the audience watches the metric recover in real time on the dashboard; incident is logged for review |

## Suggested Databricks Components

- **Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline** -- Streaming ingestion via Auto Loader or Kafka; Bronze (raw stream), Silver (parsed, deduped, enriched), Gold (windowed aggregates and alert evaluation). Streaming tables enable near-real-time dashboard refresh.
- **AI/BI Dashboard** -- Live-updating operations view with status indicators, time-series charts with threshold lines, alert feed, and entity drill-down. Auto-refresh at short intervals.
- **Genie Space** -- Real-time natural-language queries against both live aggregates and historical event tables for rapid situational awareness.
- **Knowledge Assistant** -- RAG retrieval of runbooks, SOPs, escalation procedures, and historical incident reports relevant to the current alert type.
- **Multi-Agent Supervisor** -- Orchestrates between live data queries (Genie) and procedural document retrieval (Knowledge Assistant) to provide unified incident context.
- **ML Notebook** -- Time-series forecasting for threshold-breach prediction; anomaly detection on streaming features; classification of alert severity.
- **Structured Streaming** -- Spark Structured Streaming with watermarks and windowed aggregations for sub-minute latency on derived metrics and alert triggers.
