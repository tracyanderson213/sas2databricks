# Data Quality Monitoring (Lakehouse Monitoring)

**Automatic anomaly detection** for data freshness and completeness across all tables in a Unity Catalog schema.

## Pain

Bad data silently propagates. Dashboards show stale numbers. ML models train on corrupt data. Nobody knows until a customer complains or a report is wrong. Manual monitoring doesn't scale.

## Key Features

- **Automatic freshness detection** — analyzes commit history to predict update timing; flags stale data when commits are late
- **Completeness monitoring** — tracks historical row counts, alerts when 24h additions fall below thresholds
- **Null value tracking** — detects elevated null values in columns (beta)
- **Schema-level enablement** — monitor all tables in a schema with one click, no per-table config
- **Non-invasive** — doesn't modify tables or add overhead to jobs
- **Health indicators** — results appear in Catalog Explorer with incident reports

## How It Works

Background job continuously evaluates tables:
1. **Freshness**: Predicts next expected commit from historical patterns. Late = marked stale.
2. **Completeness**: Calculates expected row count range. Below threshold = flagged incomplete.

Results surface as health badges in Catalog Explorer with detailed incident reports.

## Position

Data reliability and trust. "How do you know your dashboard shows fresh data?" "What happens when ETL fails silently?" Part of the governance story — UC doesn't just govern access, it monitors data health.

## Demo Tips

- **Enable at schema level** — one click monitors all tables
- **Show Catalog Explorer health badges** — visual data quality at a glance
- **Pair with SDP expectations** — SDP validates at build time (schema, rules), Lakehouse Monitoring validates at rest (freshness, completeness)
- **Governance story** — positions UC as more than permissions: it's your data health platform
