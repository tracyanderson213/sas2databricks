# Spark Declarative Pipelines

SDP (formerly DLT) defines medallion-architecture pipelines using streaming tables and materialized views. Transforms raw data (Bronze) through enrichment (Silver) to business-ready aggregations (Gold) in a declarative, dependency-managed framework on serverless compute.

## When to Use

- Every demo needs a pipeline — the backbone transforming synthetic raw data into Gold tables for dashboards and Genie.
- Not the centerpiece — enabling infrastructure. Build it correct and complete, not flashy.

## Key Decisions

1. **Bronze:** One streaming table per source. Schema as-is — no transforms, no cleaning.
2. **Silver:** Two roles depending on table complexity:
   - **1:1 cleaning** — when a Bronze table needs quality checks or light transforms, create a Silver counterpart with expectations (e.g., `EXPECT (order_id IS NOT NULL)`). Only create these when useful — skip pass-through tables that add no value.
   - **Joins/enrichment** — denormalize by joining Bronze/Silver tables into analysis-ready wide tables. Typically 2-4 Silver tables is enough.
3. **Gold:** Aggregations and business metrics. Design backward from dashboard and Genie needs.
4. **Data quality:** Add expectations on Silver for NULL checks on join keys and ID columns. Low effort, demos well.
5. **Pipeline mode:** Triggered with a single refresh for demos.
6. **Aggregation strategy:** Gold MVs work for a few focused aggregations. For cube-style analytics with many dimension combinations, prefer Metric Views over creating many Gold MVs.

The `databricks-pipelines` Databricks Agent Skill (DAS) handles SQL/Python implementation, Auto Loader config, and pipeline deployment.

**Design Gold backward** — start from dashboard/Genie needs, then work backward through Silver to Bronze. This prevents the most common pitfall: Gold tables that don't match downstream queries.

**Dataset types per layer:**
- **Bronze:** Streaming tables. One per source, minimal transformation.
- **Silver cleaning** (filtering, dedup): Streaming tables.
- **Silver enrichment** (joins, computed columns): Materialized views.
- **Gold** (aggregations, KPIs): Materialized views.

**Gold table design for downstream:** Clear column names (not `col1`, `amt`), descriptions with units and valid ranges, `CLUSTER BY` on filter columns.

## Pitfalls

- Gold tables not matching dashboard query needs — design Gold backward from dashboard and Genie requirements.
- Missing Silver joins leaving NULL foreign keys in Gold aggregations.
- Not running the pipeline before building the dashboard — tables must be materialized with data.
- Overcomplicated Silver with too many intermediates — 2-4 Silver tables is usually enough.
- Forgetting data quality constraints — low effort, demonstrates platform capability.
- **AI functions called from multiple MVs.** `ai_classify` / `ai_query` / `ai_extract` are slow per call. Run them once at the bronze→silver step and read the result from silver downstream — re-calling on bronze from a second MV silently doubles the pipeline time. Also scope the input to the rows the story needs; classifying everything when only a subset matters slows the demo for no benefit.

## Connections

- **Upstream (synthetic data gen):** Bronze tables ingest generated synthetic data from volumes via Auto Loader.
- **Downstream (dashboard):** Gold materialized views feed dashboard KPI cards and charts.
- **Downstream (Genie):** Genie queries Gold and occasionally Silver tables.
- **Downstream (ML/serving):** Gold tables can feed feature engineering or model training notebooks.
