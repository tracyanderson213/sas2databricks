# Delta Sharing

Open protocol for **zero-copy sharing** of live data, views, volumes and models across orgs, platforms and clouds.

## Pain

B2B data exchange today = S3 buckets, SFTP, CSVs, custom APIs. Feeds break, go stale, governance is gone once data leaves. Every new partner is a mini-integration project.

## Key Features

- **Zero-copy** — no data movement, query in place
- **Cross-platform** — works with any Delta/Iceberg client
- **Live data** — always current, no sync lag
- **Governed** — access controls, audit logs preserved
- **Volumes & models** — share files and ML models, not just tables

## Position

FSI: bureaus, partners, regulators, consortiums. Retail/MFG: supply-chain, joint-venture analytics. "We share this table with a partner — they live-query it in their own tool."

## How It Works

- **Create a "share"**: Select tables/views in UC, define who can access
- **Recipients query live**: Connect from their tool (Databricks, Spark, pandas, Power BI) — no data copy sent
- **Always fresh**: Recipients see current data, not stale exports — access controlled centrally
- **Open protocol**: Recipients don't need Databricks — any Delta Sharing client works

## Demo Tips

- Great for B2B data exchange scenarios
- Key points: zero-copy, no data movement, always fresh
- Position as the secure way to share data externally
