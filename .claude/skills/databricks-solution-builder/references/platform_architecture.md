# Full Platform Architecture: How All Products Work Together

This reference shows how ALL Databricks capabilities connect. Most demos use a subset — pick what fits your story.

**Buildable**: "Yes" = we create actual resources (dashboards, pipelines, etc.). "No" = talking point in the demo narrative.

## All Capabilities

| ID | Product | Buildable | What It Does | Relationship |
|----|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Lakeflow — Agentic data engineering: how data enters + is transformed (governed by Unity Catalog)** |||||
| `synthetic-data-gen` | Synthetic Data Generation | Yes | Generate realistic fake data for demos. Required for most use cases — simulates what real connectors would ingest | Feeds `sdp` with demo data |
| `lakeflow-connect` | Lakeflow Connect | No | A few-click interface to connect and ingest data from 100+ sources — SaaS apps, DBs, files & knowledge mgmt (Salesforce, Workday, SAP, Jira, GitHub, Confluence, SharePoint…) | Pulls from external systems |
| `lakeflow-designer` | Lakeflow Designer | No | Drag-and-drop, no-code ETL on Spark Declarative Pipelines, with zero translation loss; pairs with Genie Code | Visual front-end to `sdp` |
| `zerobus-ingest` | Lakeflow Zerobus | No | Push-based API (gRPC/REST/OTLP) for near-real-time ingestion direct to Delta tables — <5s latency, up to 10GB/s per table; Real-Time Mode down to ~5ms | Receives pushes from apps/devices |
| `delta-sharing` | Delta Sharing | No | Zero-copy sharing of live data from partners, consortiums, other orgs | Shares from external Databricks workspaces |
| `marketplace` | Databricks Marketplace | No | Subscribe to third-party datasets, AI models, solution accelerators, and native partner Apps | Subscribes to marketplace providers |
| **Compute — Infrastructure that runs workloads** |||||
| `serverless-compute` | Serverless Compute | No | On-demand compute for notebooks, ML training. No cluster management | Powers `sdp`, `ml-training-serving`, notebooks |
| `sql-warehouse` | Lakehouse (SQL Warehouse) | No | Serverless SQL compute (Photon) for BI + ad-hoc SQL over governed lakehouse tables. Databricks now surfaces this as the "Lakehouse" in the product UI (the compute behind dashboards + Genie) | Powers `ai-bi-dashboard`, `genie` |
| `lakehouse-rt` | Lakehouse Real Time (SQL Warehouse on Reyden) | No | The real-time SQL Warehouse, powered by the **Reyden** engine: millisecond queries (sub-100ms at ~12,000 q/s) directly on Delta/Iceberg — no separate serving layer, no data movement | Real-time serving for `ai-bi-dashboard`, apps, agents |
| `classic-compute` | Classic Compute | No | Traditional clusters with manual sizing. Legacy — prefer `serverless-compute` | Legacy alternative |
| **Data Processing — Transform raw data into analytics-ready tables** |||||
| `sdp` | SDP (Spark Declarative Pipelines) | Yes | Declarative ETL: Bronze → Silver → Gold. Streaming + batch, auto-optimization, Auto Loader for incremental cloud-storage ingestion; **Real-Time Mode** for millisecond latency | Consumes from ingestion |
| `ai-functions` | AI Functions | No | SQL-native AI (`ai_classify`, `ai_extract`, `ai_parse_document`, `ai_summarize`) for enriching data + document intelligence | Enriches tables within `sdp` or `notebooks-eda`; the engine under `document-parsing` (`ai_parse_document`), `information-extraction` (`ai_extract`), and `text-classification` (`ai_classify`) |
| `metric-views` | Metrics | Yes | The governed semantic / metrics layer: define KPIs once with richer semantic modeling, multi-fact relationships, and materialization — used everywhere | Sits on Silver/Gold tables from `sdp`; used by `ai-bi-dashboard` + Genie; created via SQL on a `sql-warehouse`, saved in a notebook |
| **Analytics — Query and visualize data for business insights** |||||
| `genie-one` | Genie One | No | The enterprise AI coworker: business teams ask in natural language, get governed answers, and trigger actions across 50+ tools (Slack/Teams/Jira/email…). Grounded in Genie Ontology + Unity Catalog access controls; a mobile app and a simplified interface for business users to access their data knowledge | Front door for business consumers |
| `genie-code` | Genie Code | No | A copilot that lets anyone — including non-technical business or analyst users — build data pipelines, dashboards, apps and more directly on Databricks: describe what you want, Genie Code builds it for you | Builds across all surfaces |

| `vector-search` | Vector Search | Yes | Managed embeddings + similarity search. Manual setup for custom RAG | Indexes docs from UC Volumes |
| `knowledge-assistant` | Knowledge Assistant | Yes | Fully managed RAG — point at docs, get Q&A. Answers the WHY with citations | Reads docs from UC Volumes; orchestrated by a `supervisor-agent` |
| `document-parsing` | Document Parsing | Yes | Extract structured content from documents — text, tables, and metadata. Uses `ai_parse_document` under the hood (an `ai-functions` agent) | Reads docs from UC Volumes; outputs structured content; pairs with `information-extraction`; orchestrated by a `supervisor-agent` |
| `information-extraction` | Information Extraction | Yes | Pull specific data points, entities, and fields from unstructured text. Uses `ai_extract` under the hood (an `ai-functions` agent) | Reads parsed/unstructured text; outputs to tables; orchestrated by a `supervisor-agent` |

| `genie-zeroops` | Genie ZeroOps | No | Autonomous background agent on production data + AI: detect → assess (UC-lineage root-cause) → remediate (uses your GitHub PRs / Jira) → verify (zero-copy sandbox clone). Human approval required | Watches `sdp`, ML, serving in production |
| `omnigent` | Managed Omnigent | No | Open-source (Apache-2.0) meta-harness above your agents — combine/control/share Claude Code, Codex, Pi & custom agents through one interface (swap harnesses with one-line changes; stateful cost/security policies; share live sessions by URL) | Orchestrates agent harnesses |
| `ai-gateway` | Unity AI Gateway | No | Access and govern all the main models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok and OSS), agents, MCP services and skills in one layer: unified AI spend + hard spend caps, smart quality/cost routing, end-to-end agent tracing | Governs all serving endpoints + agents |
| **Apps — Ship internal tools + agentic apps powered by the lakehouse** |||||
| `lakebase` | Lakebase | Yes | Serverless Postgres for operational workloads + the agent system of record of choice. OLTP workloads, low latency, high throughput. Instant stop/start, git-style database branching, instant backup & restore | Syncs with `sdp` tables, powers apps + agent memory |

| `genie-ontology` | Genie Ontology | No | Continuous-learning business semantic layer (fiscal calendars, org structure, metric defs, synonyms, decision rationale) — one shared source of meaning for every agent / Genie Space. The Context pillar of Agent Bricks, grounded in Unity Catalog | Grounds every agent + Genie |
| `data-quality` | Data Quality Monitoring | Yes | Lakehouse Monitoring: auto-detect freshness/completeness anomalies, profile tables | Monitors tables in UC schemas |

## Default Demo Combination

**Buildable:** `synthetic-data-gen`, `sdp`, `ai-bi-dashboard`, `genie`

**Talking track:** `lakeflow-connect`, `unity-catalog`, `genie-one` (Genie One), `genie-code` (should be almost always there)

Data flows from external systems (Lakeflow Connect) through SDP transformation, visualized in Dashboards, explored via the AI/BI Genie Agent — all governed by Unity Catalog, with **Genie One** (`genie-one`) as the business-user entry point and Genie Code assisting development. Add `knowledge-assistant` + `supervisor-agent` only when the story explicitly needs unstructured-doc lookup or multi-agent routing.
